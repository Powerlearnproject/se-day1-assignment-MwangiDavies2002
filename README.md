Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Structured programming-this emphasized clear, logical code organization using control structures like loops and conditionals.
Object-Oriented Programming- This organized software design around objects, introducing concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation
 Agile Methodologies-this suggested  iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design pecifications.\
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology approach is where each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as building a bridge whereas  Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation, ideal for software projects with evolving requirements, like developing a mobile app.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
   Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments provide a comprehensive workspace with tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Eg Visual Studio Code
Version Control Systems help in  managing changes to the codebase, enabling multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without conflicts.Eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements
Tight deadlines
Techical Debt
Strategies to overcome these are prioritization of tasks,effective communication and use of agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
 Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is designing and refining input prompt to guide Ai models to generate the desired output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of vague code is
write a code to filter out ages from data
A more precise one is
Write javascript function that will take an array of object and filter out the value of 'age'prop this is more accurate and we get finer details
